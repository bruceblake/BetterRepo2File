IMPORTANT FOR AI CODER:
1. Only modify code directly related to the current plan and instructions. Do not make unrelated changes or refactor code outside the immediate scope unless explicitly asked.
2. Preserve existing comments and docstrings unless updating them is part of the task or they become inaccurate due to your changes.
3. Ask for clarification if any instruction is ambiguous *before* making potentially incorrect changes.
4. Follow existing code style and conventions in the project.
5. If creating new files, place them in the most appropriate directory based on project structure.
6. Always provide test cases for new functionality when applicable.
7. Document any assumptions made during implementation.
8. Keep security best practices in mind - never hardcode secrets or credentials.
9. Make commits with clear, descriptive messages following the project's commit convention.
10. If modifying build configurations or dependencies, ensure compatibility with existing requirements.
