# Workflow Test Status

## Fixed Issues

1. **View Commits** - Fixed the endpoint to:
   - Properly handle GitHub URL to local repo mapping
   - Look for cloned repos in multiple job folders
   - Return commits in the correct format
   - Add error handling and display

2. **Run Tests** - Fixed the endpoint to:
   - Handle repository path resolution
   - Implement simple test result parsing
   - Add proper error messages

3. **Reset Button** - Added:
   - Complete workflow reset functionality
   - Proper styling
   - Confirmation dialog

## Current Status

- ✅ Endpoints now have proper error handling
- ✅ JavaScript has console logging for debugging
- ✅ Error messages are displayed nicely in the UI
- ✅ Reset button is fully functional

## How to Test

1. Start a new workflow with a GitHub repository
2. After generating context (Step 1), the session ID will be stored
3. In Step 4, click "View Commits" or "Run Tests"
4. Check the browser console for debugging information
5. Use the Reset button to start over if needed

## Troubleshooting

If commits/tests still don't work:
1. Check browser console for the session ID and repo URL being sent
2. Check Flask server logs for which folder it's checking
3. Verify that a repo was actually cloned in the job folder

The endpoints now have extensive logging that will help debug any remaining issues.
