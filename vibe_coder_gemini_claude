INITIAL FEATURE VIBE/GOAL:
Refined prompt:

**Aspect 1: Define the FSM States and Transitions for BetterRepo2File:**  Based on the current functionality of `bruceblake/BetterRepo2File`, identify the key states a file processing operation should transition through.  These states should include, but are not limited to, initial state, fetching repository data, parsing data, processing data, writing output, and final state (success or failure).  For each state, clearly define the possible transitions to other states based on events (e.g., successful download, parsing error, file write failure).  Document these states and transitions using a state diagram or a table.

**Aspect 2:  Implement the FSM in a Suitable Language and Framework:** Choose a suitable programming language and framework (consistent with the existing codebase of `bruceblake/BetterRepo2File`) to implement the defined Finite State Machine.  Consider using a dedicated state machine library if appropriate for maintainability and readability.  The implementation should be well-documented and include unit tests to ensure the correct transitions and handling of errors.

**Aspect 3: Integrate the FSM into the BetterRepo2File Workflow:** Integrate the implemented FSM into the existing file processing workflow of `bruceblake/BetterRepo2File`.  This should involve modifying the existing code to utilize the FSM for managing the file processing lifecycle.  Ensure that the integration does not introduce regressions in existing functionality and that the FSM enhances the robustness and error handling of
