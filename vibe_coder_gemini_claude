INITIAL FEATURE VIBE/GOAL:
Refined prompt:

The goal is to enhance the MintWebsite (https://github.com/bruceblake/MintWebsite) with a "Learn" feature.  This feature should be broken down into three key aspects:

1. **Content Identification & Organization:** Identify existing content within the MintWebsite repository suitable for a "Learn" section. This includes determining which files (e.g., blog posts, documentation, tutorials) should be included and how they should be categorized (e.g., by topic, skill level, or technology).  Provide a proposed directory structure and file organization for this new "Learn" section.  Consider the need for metadata (title, tags, description) for improved searchability and discoverability.

2. **Presentation & User Interface:**  Design a user interface for the "Learn" section. This should include navigation, search functionality, and clear presentation of the identified content.  Propose mockups or wireframes illustrating the user experience.  Consider responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, mobile).  Specify any necessary UI libraries or frameworks to be used.

3. **Integration with Existing Website:**  Detail the technical implementation plan for integrating the "Learn" section into the existing MintWebsite.  This includes specifying the necessary code changes, database modifications (if any), and API interactions.  Consider aspects like SEO optimization and potential impact on site performance.  Provide a high-level technical design document outlining the architecture and key components.
